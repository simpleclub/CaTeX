// todo: add extended support for macros
// https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/blob/9917d1ce843666c547a993f768092dc239e95c3f/src/macros.js
// already defines many macros in a nice way,
// so this could be handled similar to the symbols generation.

/// As of now, only redirecting macros are supported, i.e. essentially symbols
/// (`//..`) that rewrite to more intricate TeX input.
/// Supported macros can be found in `macros.g.dart`.
